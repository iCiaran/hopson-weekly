===Nth Smallest Number - Ends on 26th September===
Challenges are back! This is a small warmup, post submissions here and discussions in the discussion channel. 
Given an unsorted array your task is to find the nth smallest value. Explanation: imagine you have an array 
{7,6,4,5,3,2,1} the third smallest value would be 3, the second smallest value would be two.
Your program should read take two parameters, one is a .txt file with numbers in it (no line breaks), the other parameter is the value N. Determine the Nth smallest value and print it to the standard output. Print an error if such a value does not exist```
